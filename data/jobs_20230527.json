Between July 1, 2023 and the opening of the new campus, the appointee will assume a combination of teaching responsibilities at York’s Keele campus and contribute to the development of academic and research programming planned for the new Markham Campus. York University’s Markham Campus offers state-of-the-art facilities to provide innovative job-ready academic programming and research focusing on core themes of technology and entrepreneurship as applied in different contexts, disciplines, and professional fields. Building on York University’s academic presence in the City of Markham, the new campus will help fulfil future labour market and civic leadership needs by providing transferable 21st century skills that are at the core of future economic competitiveness and community development in Markham, York Region, and across Ontario. Collaboration with York University’s existing research strengths in the core areas of the new campus, and dynamic engagement with the area’s businesses and industries, will create an innovative, cross-disciplinary research culture for solving complex problems that transcend traditional disciplines.\nHiring Policies York University has a policy on Accommodation in Employment for Persons with Disabilities and is committed to working towards a barrier-free workplace and to expanding the accessibility of the workplace to persons with disabilities.
