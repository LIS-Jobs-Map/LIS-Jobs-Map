Its resources and services support scholars and researchers in the region and beyond, providing unparalleled access to rare and unique resources. Through continued expansion of its collections and partnerships, the library is dedicated to supporting teaching, research, and learning both within and beyond the university. The library has done multiple digitization projects to improve discoverability and accessibility of the library's unique and rare collections through various partnerships and is committed to developing collections in Asian Canadian studies, in collaboration with other central libraries at the UTL and external partners and community partners. The library also organizes a range of public outreach events working with campus partners, local community groups, and national and international partners to inspire scholarship and cultivate relations with the campus and the community.
