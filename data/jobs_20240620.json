The ever-increasing pace of technological development continues to have profound impacts, positive and negative, on the health and well-being of humanity and our environment. While some impacts are discipline specific, many are common to all, and hard-won insight in one domain may be of great value to other domains. The locus of university libraries at the intersection of disciplines ideally situates them to work across the university in partnership with faculties and the Vice-President Research and Innovation. Libraries can facilitate collaboration and engagement between and across domains, creating opportunities to address global issues, assimilate new technologies to enhance scholarly processes, and promote innovation.
